- a community building cryptocurrency -
because the future is now and everyone has been waiting for et
bringing proof of positive action to another dimension!

et is an agorist business education platform all guided by the ethics of
permaculture. every token minted is backed by a good deed, limiting the supply
to the progress of humanity. every project sponsored must answer 3 questions.
how does your project benefit humanity? how does your project improve the
physical planet? how does your project aim to generate surplus?

et is a community building crypto that monetizes actions for the community
anyone can earn it by having their actions verified by others holding the token this will start with
festivals move to small communities and grow into large nations!

our first real life test will be at squatch fest. at squatch the volunteers would earn tokens for
contributing and they would have their work verified by the other volunteers that have a certain amount
of their token locked up they earn a little for verifying and if they cheat they loose their locked funds
known as their trust. the are transferred to those that verify the cheat with 10% going to the treasury,
keep honest people honest. The first to verifi a cheat are those that were cheated.
tokens can be used to purchase whatever at the festival attendees can buy the token to use allowing
volunteers to cash out incentives volunteering. come to the festival with nothing earn your way in. to
get your work validated you must have a minimum of three validations and the total trust of all the
validaters must exceed the amount being paid.everyone will run a node to verify the network and earn 
a small amount for doing so. the basic node model is a rasberry pi4 that runs off a small solar panel 
and battery pack , allowing fog computing across the festival, our own internet. they can take their 
pi’s home connect them to their internet or directly to their neighbors building small community 
networks growing to a world wide network.

all that wifi is not healthy so there will be a mission to convert all the wifi frequency channels to
neutral or beneficial frequencies we call it loveG wifi.

the nodes will also work as our own social media and communication platform instead of hosting social
media on big tech servers the users will host it themselves over IPFS this will increase the power of
IPFS and give us a great place to hold our digital life. any site hosted on our nodes will be
pinned giving our users faster ipfs service. the raspberry pi is a computer we can support more than just
our network improving the internet as a whole and rewarding those that run our nodes.

in order to earn interest on the crypto you hold you will have to have your node running and connected
to the Internet or locked in a community node for a small fee, or to other nodes that are connected to
the internet if there are enough community nodes in one area then Internet is not necessary and the
blockchain can be updated as soon as the majority of nodes are able to connect to Internet allowing it to
be used in internet deserts. no need for every node to agree just the ones running the transactions in a
geographic area. We can make physical coins 3d printed or laser burned with the qr code image that
represents an exact wallet backed by the coins in it. The buyer can make exact value and the seller can
add it to their wallet by scanning the qr or just pass it on and see the value inside allowing for
anonymous transacting.

a node will also work like a ledger nano it will be a wallet when using the node for the first time and
setting it up a seed phase will be generated and if the device is ever destroyed that seed phrase can be
use to import everything into a new device also allowing nodes to be replaced or upgraded.
the more raspberry pi’s we have the more computing power giving everyone a place to add their
festival experience too, we can turn it all into non fungible tokens offer the art to the world raise more
funds and those that contribute will have a place to sell their experience and creations.
it will eventually incorporate artificial intelligence technology to run arbitrage and yield farming to pay
holders of the token for staking. We will keep adding different ways to build revenue eventually
making everyone so rich there esanen token

making everyone so rich there is no need for money
we can propose ideas to the community and members can put up their funds as loans to earn royalties
on the revenue generated from the projects such as an art project that is later sold. a restaurant where
there’s no ownership the workers are volunteering the owners are staking the profits are equally
distributed to those that contribute based on the value contributed for example at an et owned restaurant
that is built by the backing of the community you volunteer to work make a $10 sandwich sell it for a$5 
profit earn $2.50 the rest is divided into 10% for the treasury 10% to those that fund the project 10%
to your trust 10% to the evaluators and 10% to the proposal submitter everyone is incentivesed to
succeed, not only would you get part of the profits for your work you would also get the base wage that
is generated for good deeds the freshly minted et 10% of which goes to the treasury and 10% into your
trust.
everyone will have an trust pool %10 of what you earn will be locked up if you ever cheat you loose
those funds. That trust will grow earning interest over time. The longer someone uses esanen coin the
more incentive they have to be good.
create a training course the certificate would be an NFT that when used to teach others would generate
a small percentage of royalties allowing our work to feed us for as long as it is used. Fund the creation
of a movie or festival earn royalties on the profits incentives community building. with NFT’s we can
monetize everything. Want to donate your land to an event or community lock your deed into an NFT
earn royalties on the value generated. we have the ability to create the new systems of the future
gameafy community building make doing good be the mode to generate wealth.
we are recording all the time building the system everyone who participated will recive 60 tokens an
hour one a minuet with the treasury taking 10% contribution when we launch the total hours and
resources used to build it will be the pre mine we can stake our coins to be able to verify
others work and they will receive the same rate of coins an hour we can sell the tokens to attendees for
tickets and currency for the festival funding the treasury for festival supplies and allowing
volunteers to be compensated. this broadens the definition of volunteer to anyone who contributes, do a
nature walk, teach yoga, play music have others validate your work and it’s as simple as that.
community nodes will start as a cluster of four pi’4s each with two 500gb ssd’s they will require the
operator to lock up the coins they receive for creating or upgrading a node into their trust, to denture
bad behavior. Community nodes will be the foundation where all data is stored and transferred every
community will have at least three community nodes. everyone is encouraged to hold a community
node because they will earn a higher interest rate on their locked funds
community node holders will be able to vote and summit esanen proposals that will be funded by the
treasury. community nodes can be used to fund projects among their users. the royalties of witch will
go to the stakers locked funds will also earn through the use of AI bots. esanen community coin wallet
will be interoperabile allowing the storage of any crypto that can be staked to provide liquidity and
fund projects. Any coin not being traded is being staked constantly circulating their assets adding an
additional layer of privacy
